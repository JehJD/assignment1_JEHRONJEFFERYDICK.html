    <h1>A How To, On Engine Building</h1>
    <h4>By Jehron Dick</h4>

      <strong>Introduction:</strong>
    <p>

    The Most important part of any vehicle is the engine, be it Gasoline, Diesel or Electric. 
    <br>
    Without a working or powerful enough engine, a vehicle cannot fullfill it's role in transportation.
    <br>
    During the Covid 19 pandemic of 2021, I decided to use the isolation time to see to completion a long 
    dreamt project.
    <br>
    I will in this article go over some of the more important steps and things to consider, before, during and after
    an Engine rebuild for a gasoline internal combustion engine. This will be a general guide on the process and common
    practices that have been taught to me, and learned through shop manuals and respected engine builders. With this website I
    hope to encourage other people, who may be interested but apprehensive in attempting similar projects.

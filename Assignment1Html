    The Most important part of any vehicle is the engine, be it Gasoline, Diesel or Electric. 
    <br>
    Without a working or powerful enough engine, a vehicle cannot fullfill it's role in transportation.
    <br>
    During the Covid 19 pandemic of 2021, I decided to use the isolation time to see to completion a long 
    dreamt project.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="mainheader">
      <h3>Description and Purpose</h3>
    </div>
    
    <p>
    I will in this article go over some of the more important steps and things to consider, before, during and after
    an Engine rebuild for a gasoline internal combustion engine. This will be a general guide on the process and common
    practices that have been taught to me, and learned through shop manuals and respected engine builders. With this website I
    hope to encourage other people, who may be interested but apprehensive in attempting similar projects.

      <h3><strong>Step 0:Research</strong></h3>
    </div>
    <p>
    Prior to starting a project, especially one as crutial as an Engine build. There should be a full understanding and respect
    to the work that was done by the manufacturer's engineers. Factory engines are built with 3 contrasting goals, (1)Cost (2) Emmissions
    (3) Performace goals. Understanding where your Engine is designed to operate will help in understanding, it's strengths and weaknesses.
    <br>
    Many shop manuals are available online for free, and for your platform many existing forums have dedicated OEM shop manuals available and is prefered.
    <br>
    At this time,be honest to yourself.

    <strong>What are your goals?Power?Reliability?Cost?</strong>
